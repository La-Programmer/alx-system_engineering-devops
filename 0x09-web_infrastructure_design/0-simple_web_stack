1. A server is a physical or virtual computer that is responsible for responding to client requests with the required resources and functionality over a network.

2. The domain name acts as the human readable locator for the website, it is translated by the DNS into the actual IP address of the website server 8.8.8.8

3. 'www' is a CNAME record in 'www.foobar.com'

4. The web server is responsibe for serving static content on the website. In the above architecture it sends requests to the application server which generates the static content using application code base and send it to the web server to respond to the client.

5. The application server is responsible for hosting dynamic content and serving business logic from the codebase to the client. It is also responsible for generating static content that is passed to the web server which will be served to the client.

6. The server (which is a single server containing the web server and application server instances) communicates with the client over the network through HTTP requests.

The current architecture has the following weaknesses;

1. There are multile SPOF points;
   i. If the server goes down, the entire infrastructure goes down.
   ii. If the database goes down, the entire infrastructure goes down.
2. Downtimes will be experienced whenever an update is to be made to the codebase.
3. The website will be unable to scale if website traffic significantly increases.
